    "description": "This premier Class A office tower stands as a landmark in the heart of downtown Austin at 123 Congress Avenue, representing one of the city's most prestigious commercial addresses. Completed in 2018, the 125,000 square foot building exemplifies modern sustainable architecture with LEED Platinum certification, making it highly attractive to environmentally conscious tenants. The property features floor-to-ceiling windows that flood workspaces with natural light and offer stunning views of the Texas State Capitol and downtown skyline. A rooftop terrace provides tenants with an exclusive outdoor space for meetings and relaxation, while the on-site parking garage ensures convenient access. The building has achieved 92% occupancy, indicating strong market demand, and maintains a trust score of 94, reflecting excellent data verification and market position. The property is strategically located in Austin's rapidly growing tech sector, with proximity to major employers, restaurants, and entertainment venues. High-profile tenants include technology companies and professional services firms drawn to the building's modern amenities and prime location. The growing tech sector in Austin and limited Class A inventory in the downtown core present significant opportunities for continued strong performance.",
